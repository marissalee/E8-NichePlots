See timeline document for details.	Unique ID for each plot half.  Each plot consists of an invaded and native subplot	Unique ID for each plot	"Area that contains one or more plots, usually named based on the Duke Forest gate number or other identifying feature of the location"	Unique for each plot within a Site	Identifies whether the subplot  (aka plot half) is invaded or native	Dry weight (g) of aboveground Microstegium vimineum (M.v.) biomass that was harvested from 3-0.25mx0.25m quadrats	Dry weight (g) of aboveground non-M.v. plant biomass that was harvested from 3-0.25mx0.25m quadrats. Woody stems that could not be clipped were left behind.	Dry weight (g) of litter biomass that was harvested from 3-0.25mx0.25m quadrats	Available light was measured as the percent of photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) that reaches the plants relative to an full light reference (e.g. parking lot).  Measurements were taken at waist height above each of the 3 quadrats and then averaged.	Soil temperature (deg C) was measured with a soil temperature probe before vegetation and soil were disturbed					source	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Field measurement	Field measurement	Field measurement	Field measurement	Field measurement
