See timeline document for details.	Unique ID for each plot half.  Each plot consists of an invaded and native subplot	Unique ID for each plot	"Area that contains one or more plots, usually named based on the Duke Forest gate number or other identifying feature of the location"	Unique for each plot within a Site	Identifies whether the subplot  (aka plot half) is invaded or native	"Identifies whether the measurement was taken on soil sampled from different soil depth layers. CODE: F=full and 0-15cm, T=top and 0-5cm, B=bottom and 5-15cm"	"Concentration of KCl-extracted ammonium, calculated on a per soil-dry-weight basis"	"Concentration of KCl-extracted nitrate, calculated on a per soil-dry-weight basis"	"Concentration of KCl-extracted inorganic N (ammonium + nitrate), calculated on a per soil-dry-weight basis"	"Ammonification rate, measured as a lab incubation. Soil moisture during incubations was maintained at field-collected levels. Calculated as the difference in KCl-extractable ammonium between time 0 and 1. Calculated on a per soil-dry-weight basis and per day."	"Nitrification rate, measured as a lab incubation. Soil moisture during incubations was maintained at field-collected levels. Calculated as the difference in KCl-extractable nitrate between time 0 and 1. Calculated on a per soil-dry-weight basis and per day."	"Mineralization rate, measured as a lab incubation. Soil moisture during incubations was maintained at field-collected levels. Calculated as the difference in KCl-extractable inorganic N (ammonium + nitrate) between time 0 and 1. Calculated on a per soil-dry-weight basis and per day."
